=====================

Starting point to create modular and AMD apps with BackboneJS and RequireJS

Please, feel free to take a look at the code, fork it, copy it or do whatever you want with it to understand how to create a powerful yet light (thanks to AMD system) javascript app using BackboneJS + RequireJS.

You can use the file boilerplate.js as a template to create new elements in your app (such as models, collections or views).

If your are using Sublime Text 2 as your text editor, I highly recommend you [BackboneJS Plugin by Tomasz Tunik](https://github.com/tomasztunik/Sublime-Text-2-Backbone.js-package) which adds some useful shortcuts to create backbone objects in your project.

Fully based on [Thomas Davis example for Backbone Tutorials](https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials/tree/gh-pages/examples/modular-backbone-updated).
